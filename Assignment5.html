 This website will contain different varieties of books that I have read. <br>
 They vary in genre but my most read is phycology and philosophy. Under each book, <br>
there will be a paragraph going into a deep analysis of my opinions on the book. <br>
 What fascinates me is how the human brain works and how human language has developed <br>
 throughout human history. <br>
